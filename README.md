# Automatic Irrigation System

This project implements an automatic irrigation system using Arduino, designed to efficiently water plants based on soil moisture levels.

I used an Arduino board along with a soil moisture sensor to measure the soil's moisture level. When the soil is detected as dry, the submersible water pump automatically waters the soil.

Additionally, a water level sensor is installed in the water container. If the water level drops below a certain threshold, the system triggers a red LED alert, indicating the need to refill the water container.
